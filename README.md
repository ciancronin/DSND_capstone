# Data Science Nanodegree Capstone Project - Sparkify

## Key Deliverables:

* Sparkify.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook with exploratory analysis and customer churn modelling
* Sparkify_Blog_Post.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook for the blog post with images

## Libraries Used:

* Pandas
* PySpark
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## Motivation and Summary:

Deploying and using a customer churn model could help sales teams or product engineers focus on users from a marketing point of view, to send marketing incentives to - to encourage further participation in the service, or from an analysis point of view in order to track trends in users that have a certain probability of churning and testing features on them via A/B testing and other such analytical techniques. A model with 83% accuracy was created from the analysis in this project so the project purpose was successful.
